# protonats

This monorepo contains shared definitions used by the Go and Java implementation of protonats.
ProtoNATS is a protoc plugin that generates server and client code for NATS microservices, in the given target language.

Currently only Go is supported, but support for Java is on the way.

This repository will only be used after the refactor is done, in the meanwhile please refer to the [Go repository](https://github.com/d0x7/protoc-gen-go-nats) for the Go implementation.
